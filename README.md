The server can be started by entering the `/server` folder and running `node server.js`.

To start the client run `npm start` inside the `/client` folder.

## Running the tests

The server's tests can be run with jest: simply run `jest` inside the `/server` folder.

To run the client's tests, simply run `npm run test` whithin the `client` folder.
